# Dough-Not Get Eaten

The Dough-Not Get Eaten game was created as a unit 1 project for a software engineering immersive bootcamp. This game demonstrates some of the coding skills and logic in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I've acquired during the unit.

There is a 1 and 2 player option. Player click a button to jump in order to avoid the doughnut character getting eaten by a pig character. In the player 2 version, players' times are compared to announce a win.

User Stories:

Technologies Used:
Git
HTML
CSS
JavaScript with DOM manipulation

Approach:

2 classes were created in Javascript to allow for the 1 or 2 player options. The first class is called Game1 and is for the 1 player option. The second class is called Game2 and is for the 2 player option.

The G1 class was created first and used as source code for the Game2 class. HTML content is minimal as DOM manipulative is used heavily throughout both classes.

Unsolved Problems:
There's some discrepancies with the timing comparision that I believe is a result of milliseconds loading time differences.
