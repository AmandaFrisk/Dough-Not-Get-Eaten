# Dough-Not Get Eaten

The Dough-Not Get Eaten game was created as a unit 1 project for a software engineering immersive bootcamp. This game demonstrates some of the coding skills and logic in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I've acquired during the unit.

Player clicks a button to jump in order to avoid the doughnut character getting eaten by a pig character. There is a 1 and 2 player option.  In the 2 player version, players' times are compared to announce a winner.

User Stories:
As a player I want to click the 1 Player button so that it goes to the 1 player playing screen.
As a player I want to click the 2 Player button so that it goes to the 2 player playing screen.
As a player I want to click the GO button so that I can begin my turn.
As a player I want to click the JUMP button to avoid the doughnut character colliding with the mouth character.
As a player I want to be informed about which player won so that I know if I won.

Technologies Used:
Git
HTML
CSS
JavaScript with DOM manipulation

Approach:

2 classes were created in Javascript to allow for the 1 or 2 player options. The first class is called Game1 and is for the 1 player option. The second class is called Game2 and is for the 2 player option.

The Game1 class was created first and used as source code for the Game2 class. HTML content is minimal as DOM manipulative is used heavily throughout both classes.


Unsolved Problems:
There's some discrepancies with the timing comparision that I believe is a result of milliseconds loading time differences.

Forthcoming Features:
Considering changing the timing comparsion to resolve the aforementioned discrepancies.
